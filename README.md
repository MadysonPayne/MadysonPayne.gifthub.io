# About Me
## My Interests 
  - Some of my hobbies include **writing fiction**, **watching TV shows and movies**, and **traveling**. In the future, I want to have a virtual job like a data analyst and travel around the world while I work, or have a job where I need to travel for work. 
## Websites I recommend 
  - [Wikipedia] (https://wikipedia.org) - Wikipedia is a comprehensive online encyclopedia, offering a vast repository of knowledge on various topics. 
  - [GigaBrain] (https://thegigabrain.com) - This website is a neat alternative for googling with answers from real people.
